 * ***********************************   MY PLAN   *************************************************
 * it actually simple.                                                                             * 
 * I know, I know the name is not as brilliant as i would have hoped it to be.                     *
 * okay what of REFRENCING WITH ARRAY INDEXING "how about that?" i think thats beter               *
 * anyways lets get to the plan                                                                    *
 * basically its about utiliizing HOW the array data structure tranverses.                         *
 * whereby arrays have index numbers like ID that we can use to access values assigned to them.    *
 *                                                                                                 *
 *                                                                                                 *
 * Let See What Happened :      (Now follow me, follow me closely)                                 *
 * we make a separate array whereby every unique element in our input array                        *
 * is an index in that separate array. Now of course you know arrays                               *
 * assign index automatically from 0 to a given number                                             *
 *                                                                                                 *
 *                                                                                                 *
 * Thus all we have to do (You think) is this ---  int frequency[ (max of input array) + 1] = {0}  *
 * Think about it and you'll see it sure enough works.                                             *
 * Of course we have to make it all zeros, i mean a zero array                                     *
 * because what we are going to be storing in there are count values                               *
 * of unique element in our input index                                                            *
 *                                                                                                 *
 *                                                                                                 *
 * So we loop Through our input array and constantly and simultaneously                            *
 * count each unique element and update the count value in                                         *
 * our refrence array using the unique element as index in that array for updating                 *
 * unique elements count value                                                                     *
 *                                                                                                 *
 *                                                                                                 *
 * For Example: input array = {1,4,2,4,4}                                                          *
 *              refrence array =  |0|1|2|3|4|   ----- index(unique element as key)                 *
 *                                 0 1 1 0 3    ----- count values                                 *
 *                                                                                                 *
 *                                                                                                 *
 * Then lastly all we have to do is loop to refrence array                                         * 
 * and look for indexes whose count values are more than n/k.                                      *
 *                                                                                                 *
 *                            This is My Game Plan :)                                              *
