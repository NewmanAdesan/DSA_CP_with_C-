        // Your code here
        // wow wow 
        // am sure Your first approach was kadanes Algorithm
        // you will find out that will yield O(n) Time complexity
        // am sure you tried it checking from back and front
        // the fact that this case is unsorted is a problem
        
        // THE Next Simplest Approach is the two pointer Method
        // Think about it well.....and you will see it works
        // am sure it crossed you Mind a bit... 
        // but you thought it would be O(n^2)
        // NO think of it again, its actually O(n + n)
        // dont just dismiss thoughts like that
        // quickly try it out on paper
        
        // the two pointer method is actually smart and basic
        // think about it 
        // you put pointer l at 0-index
        // you put pointer r at 1-index
        // and there is a reocurring sum.
        
        // if the updating sum from l to r is less than target
        //  Move r forward
        // if the updating sum from 1 to r is greater than target
        // Move l forward
        
        // if you tackled the question you will find out this
        // two pointer Method would Work
        // Think of it and check it on paper
        // one thing that would make you think of this
        // it to realise the question is asking for end points
        // One would have taught of Sliding window Technique
        // but in this case there is no constant size
        
        // Do Something for me keep in mind how two pointer work
        // and what it helps you do in this problem
        
        // it may come in handy for a tougher problem
        // but if you have a subset solution like this
        // things can flow nicely
        // this two pointer Method has O(n) time and O(1) space
        
        
        
        // I should have Ended this analysis chat
        // but there is also another Solution
        // using a refrence array(prefix array)
        // though this one is o(n) time and o(n) space
        
        // is quite Easy to think about, 
        // am sure if you werent focused on on O(1) space 
        // you would have easily found it
        
        // idea is basic but also keep how it works in mind
        // you make a sum prefix array
        // e.g for [1,2,3,7,5] --- [1,3,6,13,18]
        // thus your work is cut in half....i believe you can see
        // what to do next, you will need another array
        // the basic idea here is to find s
        // s = arr2[i] - [an element we would have already traversed though]
        // you see that we would need a set or mat so as to use 
        // the set.find() method
        //
