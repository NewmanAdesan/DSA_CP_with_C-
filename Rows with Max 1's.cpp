/*
Given a boolean 2D array of n x m dimensions where each row is sorted. 
Find the 0-based index of the first row that has the maximum number of 1's

Input: 
N = 4 , M = 4
Arr[][] = {{0, 1, 1, 1},
           {0, 0, 1, 1},
           {1, 1, 1, 1},
           {0, 0, 0, 0}}
Output: 2
Explanation: Row 2 contains 4 1's (0-based
indexing)

Input: 
N = 2, M = 2
Arr[][] = {{0, 0}, {1, 1}}
Output: 1
Explanation: Row 1 contains 2 1's (0-based
indexing)

	    // back to what i was saying, 
	    // we could skim through each column
