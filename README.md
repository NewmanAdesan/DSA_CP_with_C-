1) How Many Techniques do You know:

            when you solve a problem or you see someone else solve a problem
            ask yourself and dont just ask, strictly analyse yourself 
             " What Primary Technique makes this code Tick"
             Know the Technique
             Name the Technique
             Know how to identify when to use the Technique
             this means to grow and learn, pay attention to 
             when others talk or solve a problem.
