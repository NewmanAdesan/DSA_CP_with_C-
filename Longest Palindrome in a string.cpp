/*
Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S.
Substring of string S: S[ i . . . . j ] where 0 ≤ i ≤ j < len(S). 
Palindrome string: A string which reads the same backwards. 
More formally, S is palindrome if reverse(S) = S. 
Incase of conflict, return the substring which occurs first ( with the least starting index)

Input:
S = "aaaabbaa"
Output: aabbaa
Explanation: The longest Palindromic
substring is "aabbaa".

Input: 
S = "abc"
Output: a
Explanation: "a", "b" and "c" are the 
longest palindromes with same length.
The result is the one with the least
starting index.

        // code here
        // okay this is not so trivial 
        // but you will get it easily and swiftly as
        // i walk you through it
        // Lets Understand the Story of this problem
        
        // Now i believe you've read and digested the question right
        // at least you should have thought of how the brute force solution
        // will be right.... in Steps
        // scroll through all the substrings available -- step 1 
        // and check it they are equal to their reverse -- step 2
        
        // step one involve two pointer going in nested loop -- O(n^2)
        // step two will also be approcimately O(n)
        // i believe implementating this brute force would be a piece of cake
        // an extra knowledge to make code shorter 
        // is the use of the string method -- substr(start_index, end_index)
        
        // Now lets get to the real reason am here.....to show you a better approach
        // now take a look at two keywords in this question
        // ------ LONGEST and PALINDROME--------
        
        // the first question you should ask yourself is
        // What is a Palindrome and how can be Observed
        // look at examples of palindromes and what can you observe
        
        // ----peep---sees----level----rotor----stats
        // i belive you will observe that 
        // that you can clasify the behaviour of palindrome into
        // two groups EVEN PALIDROME and ODD PALINDROME
        
        // Even guys   pe.ep,  se.es
        // ODD guys    le-v-el, ro-t-or, st-a-ts
        
        // baseline observation is that as you move away from the mid-guy of a word
        // the letter below and the letter above must be the same
        // So we can say the palindromic property
        // depend on the mid-guy
        
        // Now knowing that we can move through each letter in a word
        // taking each letter as a mid-guy.
        // checking the longest palindrome that can be formed with that letter
        // Do you understand e.g aaaba
        // e.g for the first letter a----- longest palindrom is 1 letter
        // for the second letter a ----- longest palindrome is 3 letters
        // You grab right.....i believe you can implement also
        
        // But our Algorithm will not be complete because through out our checking
        // we are only checking for odd numbered Palindrome
        // think about it.... it would work for words like level
        // but will fail for words like deed.....try it
        
        // So our do we check for Even numbered words to
        // would be cool if there was like a dot in between all letters
        // remember that is only how we can check for even guys right
        // But that is the answer..... we change the string a little bit
        
        // instead of working with aaaba 
        // we will work with #a#a#a#b#a#
        // thus we can check for both even and odd
